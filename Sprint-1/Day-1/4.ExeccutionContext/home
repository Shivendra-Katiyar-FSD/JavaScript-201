There are two types of execution context in JS
1. Global Execution Context 
2. Functional Execution Context

The execution context tells that the java program at a perticular moment in time have acess to which of the variables and functions in the program.

The Global execution context is created by default when we run the program and the functional execution context is only created when the program encounters a function.

Each execution context has two phases 
1. Creation phase
2. Execution phase

During the creation phase all the variables and functions present in the program are hoisted
During the execution phase all the hoisted variables and functions are assigned the values and then proceed for the execution.
